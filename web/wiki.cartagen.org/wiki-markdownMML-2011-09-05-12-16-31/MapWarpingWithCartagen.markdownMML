This is now possible with the [Cartagen Knitter](http://wiki.grassrootsmapping.org/show/CartagenKnitter).

This ought to be a separate application from the main Cartagen framework... though eventually perhaps integrated? Discuss.

Required steps:

* Ability to upload an image 
* Image may need to be stored at various sizes (attachment-fu; weardrobe code example)
* Display of an image at approx 240 x 180px with control points at corners (zoomable)
* implement projective texturing for that image
* user clicks 'save' button and it's saved as a raster image (base64)
* warped coordinates are stored
* User clicks 'complete' upon finishing the map
* ImageMagick performs the distortions at full resolution [ImageMagick docs](http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/distorts/affine/)
* image is offered as WMS? or whatever
* cartagen can import/display the tileset for tracing
