## What's Dynamic Loading? ##

Basically, if you look at cartagen.org, it loads map data in chunks, downloading new chunks every time you move the map. These come from our customized [OpenStreetMap](http://openstreetmap.org) PlanetServer and are found at the address: *http://cartagen.org/api/0.6/geohash/xxxxx.json*. This has the added benefit of only loading the data the user is looking at, not the whole map at once.

Think of it as *loading a map in smaller pieces*.

Regardless of how you set up the tiles (see later on this page for some options), you'll need to configure Cartagen to look for them instead of a static data set. 

If you've just downloaded Cartagen, you should have an **index.html** file that has the following inside:

<pre>Cartagen.setup({
			stylesheet: "static/rome/style.gss",
			static_map: true,
			static_map_layers: [
				"static/rome/park.js",
				"static/rome/rail.js",
				"static/rome/waterway.js",
				"static/rome/primary.js",
				"static/rome/secondary.js",
				"static/rome/building.js",
				"static/rome/area.js"
				],
			lat: 41.92,
			lng: 12.12
		})</pre>

Change static_map to 'false':

`			static_map: false,`

Now Cartagen will look at **/api/0.6/geohash/xxxxxx.json** for map tiles. Now you need to be sure it will find something there... read on!

## Keeping some tiles on your server ##

If you don't want to run a PlanetServer (if you're not sure, then DONT!) you can 'cheat' by just copying some files from **ours**.

Cartagen looks locally at the web root of your project for these tiles, so for smaller projects, I've downloaded the tiles and kept them in a local /api/0.6/geohash/ directory; I'm happy to zip up all Manhattan tiles for you, so email me at warren@mit.edu if you need them.

## Proxying to our PlanetServer ##

If you really do need to map the whole world, you STILL don't need to run your own PlanetServer; just BORROW OURS!

You can set up a proxy from your site to our planet server, so that any request to your site such as 'yourserver.com/api/...' would actually route to 'cartagen.org/api/...' - this would mean you'd get the latest updated version of the planet, since we try to regenerate our tiles every so often. Eventually we'll have them running with up-to-the-minute data from [OpenStreetMap](http://openstreetmap.org)

## No, really! I need my own PlanetServer! ##

You could potentially run your own PlanetServer, but it's a bit of a pain in the ass, and after all, if you only need a static dump of Manhattan, it doesn't seem like it would be a problem to simply serve the static files. 

There is more information at PlanetServer, but this is unsupported. Contact warren@mit.edu for more details, but don't expect me to do it for you!
