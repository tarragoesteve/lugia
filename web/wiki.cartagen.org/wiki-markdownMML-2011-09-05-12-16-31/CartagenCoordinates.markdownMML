The Cartagen coordinate system describes x and y coordinates for both the entire map (effectively the whole world) and for the viewport - creating confusion for some developers. Here we outline all the notable coordinate systems you can use in \JavaScript:

### Viewport coordinates ###

* **Map.lon** - the longitude of the spot on the planet the Viewport is centered on, i.e. the spot we're looking at, in longitude.
* **Map.lat** - the latitude of the spot on the planet the Viewport is centered on, i.e. the spot we're looking at.
* **Map.x** - the y position on the planet of the center of the viewport (what's on the screen). This is basically a direct projection from Map.lon.
* **Map.y** - the y position on the planet of the center of the viewport (what's on the screen). This is basically a direct projection from Map.lat.
* **Map.zoom** - ...

Map.x and Map.y may not be 1:1 scale to the pixel dimensions of the browser window. They should be related via the Map.zoom

### Mouse coordinates ###

* **Mouse.x** - The x position of the mouse pointer with regard to the Viewport in pixels
* **Mouse.y** - The y position of the mouse pointer with regard to the Viewport in pixels
* **Map.pointer_x** - The x position of the mouse pointer with regard to the _planet_ - that is, the lat/lon position of the mouse on the planet, projected into x/y.
* **Map.pointer_y** - The y position of the mouse pointer with regard to the _planet_ - that is, the lat/lon position of the mouse on the planet, projected into x/y.
